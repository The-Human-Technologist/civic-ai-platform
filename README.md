**Maintained by [The Human Technologist](https://github.com/The-Human-Technologist)** · Open-source civic intelligence for municipalities, traffic departments, and civic authorities.

Turn **existing CCTV and uploaded video** into **human-reviewed** civic and road-safety insights — without building a surveillance system or automated enforcement stack.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Available in MVP** | Demo UI, mock detections, review workflow, reports, pilot proposal |
| **Planned** | Real CV models, RTSP ingest, tickets, production auth & audit |
| **Explicitly out of scope** | Auto fines/challans, facial recognition, legal-grade speed prosecution |

> **Honest scope:** This repository ships a **working demo dashboard** with **synthetic AI detections**. It is suitable for pilots, grants, and contributor onboarding — not for production deployment without completing [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) Phases 2–5 and local legal review. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) · [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Quick start:** `npm install && npm run dev` → [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Project mission

**Help municipalities and traffic departments turn existing CCTV and video footage into human-reviewed civic and road-safety insights.**

Most cities already record video — at junctions, markets, schools, hospitals, and municipal assets — but rarely analyse it systematically for **civic maintenance** (potholes, drainage, waste) or **advisory road safety** (congestion, parking, near-miss patterns).

This project provides an open, auditable software foundation that:

1. Accepts **footage you already have** (upload today; RTSP in a later phase)
2. Produces **structured detection events** with confidence scores and evidence placeholders
3. Requires **official human review** before any ticket, report, or field action
4. Surfaces **analytics** for departments — not automatic penalties

We call this **civic intelligence** and **municipal operations analytics**, not surveillance.

---

## Why this matters

Urban agencies face predictable, recurring problems that video could help surface earlier — if workflows respect privacy and human oversight.

| Problem | Why it hurts | How this project helps (when fully deployed) |
|---------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Potholes & road damage** | Accidents, vehicle damage, citizen complaints | Flag surface defects for PWD / municipality repair queues |
| **Waterlogging** | Monsoon disruption, health risk, traffic chaos | Map drainage failure hotspots from standing-water detections |
| **Garbage overflow** | Sanitation backlog, blocked drains | Alert solid-waste teams with geo-tagged evidence |
| **Illegal parking** | Blocked fire lanes, bus stops, footpaths | Highlight recurring zones for **manual** enforcement planning |
| **Wrong-way driving** | Junction risk, especially near markets & schools | Advisory flags for signage / traffic engineering review |
| **Road blockage** | Fallen debris, construction dumps | Faster clearance coordination |
| **Congestion** | Lost time, emissions, emergency delays | Congestion index for signal timing & corridor studies |
| **Delayed civic response** | Issues worsen before tickets exist | Earlier structured alerts → review → department routing |
| **Manual monitoring overload** | Control rooms cannot watch every feed | AI pre-filter → humans decide what matters |

**Today (MVP):** the dashboard **demonstrates** this workflow with **fake detections** and sample Barasat geography so stakeholders can evaluate UX, governance, and privacy posture before investing in real models.

---

## Who can use it

| Audience | Typical use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Municipalities** | Civic issue triage, ward-level hotspot reports, pilot proposals |
| **Traffic police** | Advisory road-safety analytics (not auto-challan) |
| **Transport departments** | Corridor studies, school-zone safety reviews |
| **Smart city teams** | Integration planning with existing CCTV inventory |
| **Gated communities** | Internal maintenance & parking pattern review |
| **Schools & hospitals** | Zone safety advisory around entrances (with authorization) |
| **Market associations** | Waste & congestion coordination with local bodies |
| **Civic-tech researchers** | Open codebase for privacy-preserving video analytics study |

**Deployers** must obtain legal authorization to process video in their jurisdiction. This software does not grant that permission.

## Privacy-first design

Privacy is a **product requirement**, not a marketing footnote.

| Principle | MVP | Planned |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| **No facial recognition by default** | Enforced — feature absent; UI locked off | Remains off unless separate legal RFC |
| **No automatic fines or challans** | No enforcement code paths | Explicit non-goal |
| **Human review required** | Every detection reviewable before action | Server-enforced gates |
| **Fake sample data only** | All `EVT-BRS-*` events synthetic | Real data only in authorised deploys |
| **Privacy masking** | Settings UI placeholders | Blur faces & mask plates on ingest |
| **Audit logs** | Client-side review timestamps | Immutable server audit trail |
| **Role-based access** | Not implemented | Viewer / reviewer / admin |
| **Limited retention** | 30-day default in settings UI | Automated purge on object storage |

## Government demo positioning

### Designed for 30-day municipal pilots

The included [**Pilot Proposal**](/pilot-proposal) page (`/pilot-proposal`) describes a realistic evaluation pattern:

| Pilot element | What we demonstrate |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **One road** | Barasat Station Road corridor (sample) |
| **One junction** | Colony More Junction (sample) |
| **Uploaded CCTV footage** | Video file upload + demo feed cards |
| **Human review** | Official confirm / reject / field-verify workflow |
| **Civic reports** | Printable 30-day report & department summaries |
| **No enforcement automation** | Zero challan, prosecution, or facial ID integration |

This lets a municipality, traffic unit, or WEBEL team **evaluate software workflow and governance** before procurement of GPU inference, RTSP integration, or production hosting.

### Option A — One click from GitHub

1. Open [github.com/The-Human-Technologist/civic-ai-platform](https://github.com/The-Human-Technologist/civic-ai-platform)
2. Click **Code** → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace on main**
3. Wait for the container to build (`npm install` runs automatically)
4. In the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. When prompted, **open port 3000** in the browser (or use the **Ports** tab → globe icon)

### Option B — VS Code / Cursor with Dev Containers

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Open the folder in VS Code or Cursor
3. **Reopen in Container** (uses `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`)
4. Run `npm run dev`

### Codespaces tips

| Tip | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| **No secrets needed** | Mock MVP runs without `.env` changes |
| **Free tier** | Student Pack includes Codespaces hours — see [education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack) |
| **CI matches local** | Same checks as GitHub Actions: typecheck → lint → build |
| **Stuck?** | Open an issue with the **Bug report** template |

## Installation

Same as [Quick start](#quick-start-local). For cloud development, use [GitHub Codespaces](#github-codespaces-zero-install).

## Deploy on Vercel

This app is a standard **Next.js 16** project and deploys to Vercel (or any Node host that supports `next build` / `next start`) with **no secrets required** for the mock MVP.

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
cd civic-ai-platform
git init   # if not already a repo
git add .
git commit -m "Initial civic AI platform MVP"
git remote add origin https://github.com/The-Human-Technologist/civic-ai-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Import in Vercel

1. Open [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and **Import** your GitHub repository.
2. **Root Directory:** `civic-ai-platform` if the repo is a monorepo; otherwise leave as `.`.
3. **Framework Preset:** Next.js (auto-detected).
4. **Build Command:** `npm run build` (default).
5. **Output:** Next.js default (no static export).

### 3. Environment variables (Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables)

| Variable | Required for MVP | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Recommended | `https://your-app.vercel.app` |
| `AI_PROCESSING_MODE` | Optional | `mock` |
| `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | Optional | `local` |
| `MAP_PROVIDER` | Optional | `none` |

`DATABASE_URL` and `AUTH_SECRET` are **not needed** until Phase 2+ / Phase 5+.

### 4. Deploy

Click **Deploy**. Vercel runs `npm install` and `npm run build` automatically.

After the first deploy, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production URL and redeploy so Open Graph links resolve correctly.

### 5. Verify production

- `/` — landing page loads
- `/dashboard` — KPIs and charts render
- `/pilot-proposal` — printable pilot document
- `/opengraph-image` — OG image (or share link preview in Vercel / social debuggers)

### Other hosts (Railway, Render, Docker)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start   # listens on PORT (default 3000)
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your public URL. No database or Redis is required for the MVP.

---

## How mock AI processing works (MVP)

All inference is **client-side and synthetic**:

```
Upload or demo feed
    → simulateUploadProgress()
    → processVideoMock()          # src/lib/mock-ai/processor.ts
    → DetectionEvent[]            # randomised confidence, fixed seed IDs
    → event-store (localStorage)
    → Dashboard & review UI
```

Seed data: **35 events** (`EVT-BRS-2401` … `2435`), public Barasat place names only — [synthetic data policy](src/lib/data/README.md).

---
